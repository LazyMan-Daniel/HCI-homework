    <h2>1. Abstract</h2>
    <p>The Daniel's BEER PONG will be the perfect app for people that love to party and drink. This app is based on the classic game of "Beer pong"
        that can be played in real life only if the people have: a big table, disposable cups, ping pong balls and alcohol. The app will have 2 modes:
        singleplayer and multiplayer. 
    </p>

    <h2>2. Introduction - the purpose of the project</h2>
    <p>The app was build based on the notions learned from "Human-computer interface" class. Every element was chosen and positioned in such
        a way that the navigation through the app would be easy and fast. In the process of choosing every button of the interface i have asked
        at least 5 friends which button do they consider to be the best to suggest the functionality of them.

    <h2>4. Interface description</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Design</h3>
    <p>The game was designed for people 18+, because it is based on drinking alcohol in real life. The predominant colors used are: blue, red, green and pink
        with the purpose of making the game more attractive to the player. Every button in this game is based on icons that are used in IOS and 
        Android apps, so that the player will already be familiarised with them.
